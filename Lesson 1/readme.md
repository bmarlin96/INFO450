# Python for Data Analytics - Class 1

## Course Overview
Welcome to the first class of **Python for Data Analytics**. In this session, we'll cover the basics of Google Colab and dive into descriptive statistics, including Tukey's 5-number summary.

## Google Colab Introduction
Google Colab (Colaboratory) is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. It's perfect for data analysis tasks because it provides access to powerful computing resources and a variety of pre-installed libraries.
